And as we all know, good work is reinforced by good habits and is an enemy of the clock. That’s why it is important to understand that polish does not exist as a discrete phase at the end of the project, but it does make up the project itself.</h4>

When approaching an assignment, there’s always a certain amount of ground work which needs to be completed before the real work begins. This is where having frameworks to reference in order to solve common tasks can allow designers and developers to do a high amount of the work in a very short amount of time.</h4>
